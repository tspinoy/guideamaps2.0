In this section, I would like to express my appreciation to the people who contributed directly or indirectly to the result of this thesis.\\

First of all, I want to say a heartfelt thank you to professor Olga De Troyer for being my promoter, but also for proofreading this thesis many times, being there every time I needed advice or had questions, answering my numerous e-mails very quickly, ... the whole year. Next to my promoter, my assistant during this thesis, Jan Maushagen, also deserves a big thank you for all the time and effort he has put in giving me tips and tricks about the implementation.\\

Further, I would like to thank C\'esar Callebaut and the schools he contacted to find participants for the user study.\\

Last but not least, a special and important group of people needs to be thanked as well: my family. From my parents for giving me the chance and faith to study Computer Science for five years, over my sister and in-laws to my fantastic girlfriend, who I can always count on. Dank u Yanake!
